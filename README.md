# Axial-Light-Cube
Introducing, the Axial Light Cube, your ultimate companion for elevating coin photography to new heights of precision and excellence.
Designed specifically for numismatic enthusiasts, coin collectors, and sellers alike, this innovative cube revolutionizes the way you capture and present the beauty of your prized coins.

What is Axial Lighting?

Axial lighting in coin photography refers to a specialized lighting technique where the source of light is positioned directly in line with the optical axis of the camera. This technique involves illuminating the subject (in this case, the coin) from multiple angles along this axis, ensuring even and uniform lighting across the surface of the coin. Axial lighting in coin photography aims to eliminate inconsistencies in lighting, providing a clear, uniform illumination that accentuates the features and enhances the overall visual appeal of the coin, making it an invaluable technique for enthusiasts, collectors, and sellers looking to capture the true essence and beauty of their coins in photographs.

Why the Axial Light Cube?

The Axial Light Cube is a cost effective and convenient way to get great photos of your coins without requiring an entire room dedicated to an axial lighting set up. Typical professional axial lighting setups are very expensive which prevents beginner coin catalogers, enthusiasts, and sellers from being able to get great coin photos. If you're a seller of coins, great photos set you apart from the competition, so don't let bad cell phone photos stop you from making sales. The Axial Light Cube practically pays for itself with the amount of new sales you will receive! Using 3d printing technologies allows the Axial Light Cube to be affordable which allows us to pass the savings on to you!
A separate light source is required but any moderate lamps should work great! The light bounces off the glass located inside of the Axial Light Cube and reflects the light directly down onto the coin. The glass is situated in a 45 degree angle to insure proper coin illumination. The hole at the top of the cube allows you to photograph your coin from the top down. Feel free to use your mobile phone or your professional camera but we recommend having a camera that can zoom slightly without a major loss in photo quality to make post processing easier.
The Axial Light Cube accommodates a range of coin sizes and shapes, guaranteeing reliable and impeccable outcomes on every occasion. From dimes to large dollar coins, the Axial Light Cube effortlessly accommodates various coin dimensions, ensuring consistent and flawless results across the spectrum. The Axial Light Cube is designed to only photograph raw coins. Graded coins or coins in flips will not fit in the Axial Light Cube.
